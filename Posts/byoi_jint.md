## Background

Bring Your Own Interpreter is technique thas has been employeed by red teams to achieve code execution. The concept of embedding your favorite scripting languages interpreter into a payload becomes more attractive. Especially, as more runtime, logging and insight defenses are built into PowerShell due to its widespread abilities. The SilentTrinity framework already makes use of the concept by utilizing the [Boo scripting language](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/SILENTTRINITY/tree/master/silenttrinity/core/teamserver/data). One could also use [IronPython, IronRuby, F#,](https://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/derbycon9/1-17-red-team-level-over-9000-fusing-the-powah-of-net-with-a-scripting-language-of-your-choosing-introducing-byoi-bring-your-own-interpreter-payloads-marcello-salvati) and so on to achieve this.
