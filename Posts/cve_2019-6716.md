# What I Discovered By Mistyping A URL (CVE 2019-6716)
_____________________________________________________________________


### Preface
I have to admit that the issue I discovered is not as serious or as impressive as a vulnerability that allows for remote code execution or privilege escalation. However, I did find it interesting due to what this affected web application was built for and the potential attack vectors that could be leveraged due to it.

### Overview
LogonBox Limited's (formerly Nervepoint technologies) and Hypersocket software's Access Manager is a virtual web application appliance that integrates with an on-premise [Active Directory environment](https://docs.logonbox.com/app/manpage/en/article/413106/Connecting-to-an-Active-Directory) and off-premise solutions such as Google's G Suite service. In turn, this allows users part of an organization that utilizes this product to manage their Active Directory and cloud accounts all through Access Manager. Furthermore, it allows organizations that may not have enough resources to allocate to a full-fledged help desk group cut back on help calls that involve the mundane and sometimes time-consuming process of resetting a user's password or unlocking an account. However, I've noted some concerns below in how some these mechanisms work via a publicly accessible web application.

##### Official Summary Of Issue
> An unauthenticated Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability in LogonBox Limited's (formerly Nervepoint Technologies) Access Manager web application allows a remote attacker to enumerate internal Active Directory usernames. It also allows for the possibility to enumerate Active Directory group names and altering of back-end server jobs (backup and synchronization jobs) depending on the configuration of the system. This is done via the manipulation of the jobId HTTP parameter in an HTTP GET request. This issue affects Access Manager versions >= 1.2 <= 1.4-RG3 and has been rectified in versions >= 1.4-RG4.

Finding the issue in the web application was really quite simple after accidentally mistyping the URL. It took me a couple of seconds to realize what was happening as I wasn't purposefully auditing the web application for any vulnerabilites. As I incremented the number in the jobId parameter, Active Directory usernames and potentially AD group names were being returned in the responses. I could see users who had recently changed their passwords and then the synchronization jobs running for different AD groups that these users were part of. I was also presented with the possible chance to cancel these sync jobs, backup jobs and other types of jobs if I wanted **(Spoiler alert: I didn't try to see if I could).** I informed the Hypersocket software team of this issue immediately and I received a prompt response that they were able to rectify the issue and push out the patch to their customer base.

I was informed after further testing by the Hypersocket team that they were only able to enumerate a limited number AD usernames (2 to 3 out of a sample of 150). They weren't able to enumerate AD group names or cancel any jobs running on the back-end. However, in my case, I was able to enumerate many more AD usernames. This is most likely due to the fact that the sample size I was working with was much larger. I suspect that the possibility to enumerate AD group names and cancel jobs running on the back-end may be dependent on the configuration of a specific instance of Access Manager that is running at the time.

### Proof Of Concept
Again, this issue was trivial to identify. It has the classic behavior of an Insecure Direct Object Reference vulnerability. Simply changing the integer value for the jobId HTTP GET parameter did the trick.

```markdown
 https://host.example.com/runJob.html?76&jobId=<#>
```
Furthermore, I discovered that removing a small portion (76&) from the URL had no effect on the content in the webpage that was produced from a response. This means there was no need for finding a pattern or predicting the integer value that would be produced every time a  new request was sent. Do you know what that means?

```markdown
 https://host.example.com/runJob.html?jobId=<#>
```
This means that an attacker can easily automate requests with a tool such as PortSwigger's Brupsuite intruder module. This made it easier to identify what types of jobs were running on the back-end of the server that an unauthenticated attacker could access from the main public page of the web application.

While automating the requests with the Burpsuite intruder tool, I discovered a multitude of information that shouldn't be accessible to an unauthenticated user. This information included:
 * The username schema that the organization uses for internal Active Directory usernames
 * Enumeration of internal Active Directory usernames
 * Enumeration of internal Active Directory group names (in this specific instance)
 * Enumeration of AD users who have recently changed their passwords
 * Enumeration of back-end server jobs running with the possibility to alter or interact with their states/status
   * Synchronization jobs
   * Backup jobs
   * Rebuild jobs
   
   
### Potential Opportunites To Leverage From The Perspective Of An Attacker
#### Password Spraying/Reverse Brute forcing
The username enumeration aspect of this issue makes this activity much more trivial since we have half of the equation; all we need is a valid password. Believe it or not people still use awful passwords. To make this aspect even worse, some people like to reuse their password(s) across multiple online services, work account, school account, etc. These things are what currently makes password spraying the best thing since sliced bread. Keep in mind that one would have to be cognizant of the account lockout policies in place in the internal or [Azure AD](https://docs.logonbox.com/app/manpage/en/article/512873/Connecting-to-an-Azure-Active-Directory) environments since Access Manager can tie in with either of those. 
 
 **If you have the ability to turn on any multi-factor authentication for anything I would strongly suggest you do so immediately!!!**
 
#### Possible Account Take Over & Gaining A Foothold In The On-Prem AD Environment or Cloud Services 
In my case, the running instance of Access Manager also didn't have a very secure **(in my opinion)** way of letting users reset their password if they forgot it or if they get locked out of their account. For a user to reset their password or unlock their account they simply need to answer 3 of 5 secret personal questions. The same problem concerning the way users choose their passwords also applies to how users pick their super-duper secret answers to their secret questions.

![Secret Questions](Post%20Images/password-reset.jpg)

 * **Secret question:** What was the first car you owned?
 * **Super-duper secret answer:** ford, toyota, rav4, corolla, etc.
 * **A potentially better answer:** sterling silver general motors company sierra, etc. _(Plus one if the answer is case sensitive)_
 * **An even better answer:** Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet _(That's not a car, that's a twin-engine, carrier-capable, multirole fighter aircraft)_
 
Do you see what I mean? A wordlist of car makes and models could easily be crafted. Access Manager also allows users to set their own secret questions. _What is your favorite color?_ Not to mention at this point an attacker could make reasonable inferences or perform OSINT on individuals with the list of usernames they enumerated. Due to these aforementioned aspects, the process of resetting or unlocking an Active Directory account through a web portal can be made trivial or at least lessen the effort required of an attacker to do so. 

In addition, Access Manager allows an administrator to [enable multiple methods for authentication](https://docs.logonbox.com/app/manpage/en/article/532476/Allowing-multiple-Authentication-Methods-to-be-active-for-login-processes-in-Access-Manager) such as OTP, PIN, SMS, etc. At least one to two alternative [authentication methods](https://docs.logonbox.com/app/manpage/en/article/532236/Authentication-Basics:-Configuring-and-managing) should be used to replace the secret questions method or at least be a supplemental step in this case.

**It should be noted that using secret questions and answers is _NOT_ a valid form of MFA, nor is it a good way to verify the identity of a user! The password and answers to the secret questions are both something the user knows.**

#### Possible Denial of Service
During the automation of the requests, I also discovered that I possibly had the opportunity to cancel backup jobs, synchronization jobs and other jobs running on the back-end. This could possibly affect an organization in multiple ways. Such as users not having the ability to access their accounts, various services, etc.


### Conclusion
I'd also like to mention that LogonBox Limited & Hypersocket Software allow for the integration of the [yubico key](https://www.yubico.com/works-with-yubikey/catalog/logonbox/) for multi-factor authentication. I'm not entirely sure if this can integrate with the on-prem Access Manager product as opposed to their cloud solution.
