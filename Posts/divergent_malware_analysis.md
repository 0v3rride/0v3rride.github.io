# Divergent: Divergent: The Curious View Into The Mind Of A Malware Creator (Part 1)
_____________________________________________________________________


### Preface
Once upon a time at Microsoft Corporation sometime in 1996, one person thought it would be a good idea to allow for arbitrary code execution and calls to the Operating System via webpages rendered in Internet Explorer. This idea came in the form named [ActiveX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActiveX), but more specifically ActiveX controls. ActiveX controls are very similar to Java applets, which in short means they're dangerous too. This is not a new revelation, but it is a problem that continues to persist in the Windows ecosystem, even the with the release of Windows 10 and IE 11.
